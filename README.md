# Steam Ratings
 

### Created by Jesse Gay (MrShade138)



We will be examining the difference between ratings and player reviews on games on the [Steam Platform](https://store.steampowered.com/).
We will also be looking at differences across the game maturity ranking system.
Data pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedtarek01234/steam-games-reviews-and-rankings) created by Mohamed Tarek 01234.
We adjusted the player ratings to numeric from a review statement in the following way:

1.	Overwhelmingly Positive
2.	Very Positive
3.	Mostly Positive
4.	Positive
5.	Mixed
6.	Mostly Negative
7.	Very Negative
	
We also collected four samples that did not have enough data to fall into these categories as Null values.
